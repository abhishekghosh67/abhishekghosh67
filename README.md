I'm Abhishek Ghosh, a Certified Scrum Master and results-driven professional with over 8 years of experience in project management, data operations, and leadership. My expertise spans across India, APAC, and Europe, where I’ve led diverse teams to success, optimized operations, and delivered value to top-tier clients like Pfizer, Takeda, and AT&T.

I specialize in data management, business optimization, and cross-functional collaboration and have a passion for transforming challenges into opportunities for growth.

I’m currently looking for opportunities to expand my contributions in operations management, data analytics, and leadership roles.
